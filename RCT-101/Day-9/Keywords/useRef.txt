What is useRef?
The useRef hook is the new addition in React 16.8. Before proceeding to this article 
there is a prerequisite to know about the ref in react.
The useRef is a hook that allows to directly create a reference to the DOM element 
in the functional component. 

Syntax:

const refContainer = useRef(initialValue);
The useRef returns a mutable ref object. This object has a property called .current. 
The value is persisted in the refContainer.current property. These values are 
accessed from the current property of the returned object. The .current property 
could be initialised to the passed argument initialValue e.g. useRef(initialValue). 
The object can persist a value for a full lifetime of the component.
